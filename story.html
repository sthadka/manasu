                            <p> At first, I thought maybe it could be the
                            weather , time, day or the place that made us feel
                            we are perfect for each other. But when I now
                            think over it, neither of them played any part ...
                            the weather may be to an extent because it made
                            our conversation more euphonious.  </p>

                            <p> I have heard "it is all about two people
                            meeting at the right time" but I feel, if two
                            people make the time right, that is when the spark
                            ignites and you just know he/she is the right one.
                            That is how I found my soul mate in Sukumar may
                            be. He came across as an astute, sometimes jocular
                            and a very articulate person and all our
                            imperfections seemed perfect. Throughout the
                            meeting, he just made my ocean of complicated
                            thoughts about "my kinda guy", come out as smooth
                            waves one by one and by the end of the meeting I
                            was certain that he is the kind of guy I am
                            looking for.  </p>

                            <p> Our weird and crazy perceptions about life,
                            our interests couldn't have matched better. He is
                            a little more crazy than me, he is definitely more
                            knowledgeable, he has better understanding of
                            things than me and many more things which I will
                            find out once we are together. I hardly believe in
                            luck, but this time I definitely got lucky :) </p>

                            <p> Smile. I never realized that something so
                            innocent could change someone's life so much. When
                            I first saw her, she was like a million smiles.
                            One of those smiles could brighten anyone's day.
                            Little did I know that it was to brighten my life.
                            </p>

                            <p> We met for the first time at a coffee day near
                            our house. I remember I had ordered a cappuccino
                            and she ordered chocolate ice cream. I was kind of
                            speechless looking at this beautiful girl in front
                            of me when she started rattling out about stuff.
                            Things kind of took off from there. All along I
                            felt as if I was talking to a good friend whom I
                            had known for ever. By the end of the evening, we
                            were both in smiles and a different sense of
                            happiness.  </p>

                            <p> One of my friends used to say, you know you
                            have met the right person when you feel your life
                            was in black and white before and its now in
                            color. This is exactly how I feel about Mansi. Its
                            just wonderful meeting a person who cares more
                            about others than herself and is forever curious,
                            has an amazing voice and great moves, who is so
                            full of energy and so full of life. We met against
                            all odds and now this insanely lucky guy can call
                            her mine.  </p>
